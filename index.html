            This article is about the Cold War rivalry between
            <strong> the United States </strong> and
            <strong> Soviet Union </strong>.

          The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War">Cold War</a>
          rivals, the Soviet Union and the United States, to achieve superior
          spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the ballistic
          missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations following
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a>. The technological advantage
          demonstrated by spaceflight
          achievement was seen as necessary for national security, and became
          part of the symbolism and ideology of the time. The Space Race
          brought pioneering launches of artificial satellites, robotic space
          probes to the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low
          Earth orbit and ultimately to the Moon.

          The competition began on July 30, 1955 when the United States
          announced its intent to launch artificial satellites for the
          International Geophysical Year. Four days later, the Soviet Union
          responded by declaring they would also launch a satellite "in the
          near future". The launching of satellites was enabled by
          developments in ballistic missile capabilities since the end of
          World War II. The competition gained Western public attention with
          the "Sputnik crisis", when the USSR achieved the first successful
          satellite launch, Sputnik 1, on October 4, 1957. It gained momentum
          when the USSR sent the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into space with
          the orbital flight of Vostok 1 on April 12, 1961. These were
          followed by a string of other early firsts achieved by the Soviets
          over the next few years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gagarin's flight led US president John F. Kennedy to raise the
          stakes on May 25, 1961 by asking the US Congress to commit to the
          goal of "landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the
          Earth" before the end of the decade. Both countries began developing
          super heavy-lift launch vehicles, with the US successfully deploying
          the Saturn V, which was large enough to send a three-person orbiter
          and two-person lander to the Moon. Kennedy's Moon landing goal was
          achieved in July 1969, with the flight of Apollo 11, a singular
          achievement considered by the Americans as overshadowing any
          combination of Soviet achievements that have been made. However,
          such an opinion is generally contentious, with others attributing
          the first man in space as being a much larger achievement.
